## Introduction

Chain Reaction is a strategy game that requires players to place orbs in cells. When a cell reaches a critical mass, it explodes, sending orbs to neighboring cells and potentially causing a chain reaction. The goal is to dominate the board by eliminating your opponent's orbs.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The game board adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Handles cell clicks, explosions, and turn-based logic.
- **Visual Feedback:** Clear visual indicators for player turns and game over states.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/chainreaction.git
    cd chainreaction
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the game.

## Usage

1. Click on any empty cell to place an orb.
2. When a cell reaches a critical mass, it explodes, sending orbs to neighboring cells.
3. The game continues until one player dominates the board.

## Development History

This project has an interesting history. It initially started as a command-line user interface (CUI) developed in Java. This version was created as part of a hackathon project by myself and my teammates Malavika and Anusha. After the hackathon, I decided to enhance the game by developing a graphical user interface (GUI) using modern web technologies.
